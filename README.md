# Data Structures Using C

Welcome to my repository for **Data Structure implementations in C**. This project includes fundamental data structures built from scratch, showcasing core logic, pointer manipulation, and algorithm design. It's aimed at learning and demonstrating how common data structures work under the hood. 
 
## ðŸ“¦ Topics Covered

- âœ… Singly Linked List  
- âœ… Doubly Linked List  
- âœ… Circular Linked List  
- âœ… Stack (Array & Linked List)  
- âœ… Queue (Array, Circular, Linked List)  
- âœ… Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree  
- âœ… Hash Tables  
- âœ… Sorting & Searching Algorithms
